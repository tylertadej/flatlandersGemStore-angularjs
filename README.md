Flatlander's Gem Store
=========

AngularJS web application as seen on [Angular.CodeSchool.com]


> Learn to build an application using Angular.js -- this FREE course is sponsored by Google and brought to you by CodeSchool.com  

> This specific repo was made by cloning the [Angular-Seed] project which is a great way to get up and running quickly with a bare-bones Angular app. After that I replayed the course as well as cruised around GitHub looking at code from other CodeSchool students.

> There are many ways to do things in Angular and the methods here might not be best practices across the board but they will give you a good overview of the possibilities of this framework. Don't forget to download the [slides from the course]

```sh
# Clone repo using SSH (HTTPS works too!)
