> Learn to build an application using Angular.js
> This FREE course is sponsored by Google
> This project was made by cloning the [Angular-Seed] project which is a great way to
> get up and running quickly with AngularJS. After that I cruised around GitHub picking up bits of code and also replayed the course.

  - After completing the course download the repo and build your own features
  - Replay the course and follow along
  - Figure out how to make the app more efficient
  - Add your own content and make a completely different app!


Installation
--------------
##### This has not been tested yet but should work ;)
```sh
# Clone repo using SSH (HTTPS works too!)
$ git clone git@github.com:tylertadej/flatlandersGemStore-angularjs.git

# Navigate to that directory
$ cd flatlandersGemStore-angularjs

# Assuming you have NodeJS/NPM installed run
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Assuming that goes well navigate to ```localhost:8000/app/ ``` in your browser


TODO
----
	- Add dates to reviews
	- Fetch and publish time for new reviews
	- Improve readme
